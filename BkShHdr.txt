BkShHdr is a Plug-in software of Becky! Ver.2(maybe or later) that displays
header you list up on other windows.
It is useful for...
* to display X-Mailer, Organization or other headers
* to identify redirect mail

[Installation]
exit Becky!
Copy BkShHdr.dll to Becky!'s Plug-in directory
(maybe C:\Program Files\RIMArts\B2\PlugIns)
Boot Becky!

[Source codes]
This program is written for Borland C++ Builder(Ver.1.0)

[Configuration]
You can specify headers with Becky!'s menu[tool]->[plug-in(?)]->[BkShowHeader]
(I have no English version of Becky, so I don't know where to customize)
